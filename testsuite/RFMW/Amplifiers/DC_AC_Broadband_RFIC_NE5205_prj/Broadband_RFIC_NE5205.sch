  <Text 140 690 12 #000000 0 "Notes:\n\nThe design is based on the use of multiple feedback loops to provide wide-band gain together with good noise figure and terminal\nimpedance matches. Referring to the circuit schematic in Figure 17, the gain is set primarily by the equation:\n\nV_{OUT}/V_{IN} = (R_{F1} + R_{E1})/R_{E1}\n\nwhich is series-shunt feedback. There is also shunt-series feedback due to R_{F2} and R_{E2} which aids in producing wideband terminal\nimpedances without the need for low value input shunting resistors that would degrade the noise figure. For optimum noise\nperformance, R_{E1} and the base resistance of Q_1 are kept as low as possible while R_{F2} is maximized.\n\nThe noise figure is given by the following equation:\n\nNF = 10 · log(1 + ((r_b + R_{E1} + (k·T)/(2·q·I_{c1}))/R_O)) [dB]\n\nwhere I_{C1} = 5.5mA, r_b = 130 Ω, KT/q = 26mV @ 25ºC and R_O = Z_0\n\nThe output stage is a Darlington pair (Q_6 and Q_2 ) which increasesthe DC bias voltage on the input stage (Q_1 ) to a more desirable\nvalue, and also increases the feedback loop gain. Resistor R_0 optimizes the output VSWR.\nInductors L_1 and L_2 are bondwire and lead inductances which are roughly 3nH. In the original circuit, they improve the high-frequency impedance\nmatches at input and output by partially resonating with 0.5pF of pad and package capacitance.\n\nReference:\nProduct datasheet.
